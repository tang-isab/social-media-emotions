## Description
This project compares three sentiment analysis models—SVM (TF-IDF), SVM (word embeddings), and BERT—on social media posts. Historically, SVMs were dominant in NLP before transformer-based models like BERT, which leverage contextual understanding for superior accuracy.

## Key Findings
**Metrics**:  
| Model                 | Accuracy | F1-Score |  Recall  | Precision |
|-----------------------|----------|----------|----------|-----------| 
| SVM (TF-IDF)          | 0.86     | 0.81     | 0.81     | 0.82      |
| SVM (Word Embeddings) | 0.31     | 0.11     | 0.17     | 0.24      |
| BERT                  | 0.97     | 0.92     | 0.91     | 0.93      |
